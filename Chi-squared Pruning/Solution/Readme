IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION TREE LEARNING ALGORITHM AND CHI SQUARE PRUNING TECHNIQUE

Language used : Python
Interpreter : Python 3.8.8

The file ‘Source.py’ contains the source code for the program which implements decision tree learning algorithm and pruning technique.

The program accepts an input file named 'restaurant.csv' containing the dataset. The dataset contains 12 examples each of which have 10 attributes and a final outcome. 

Please run the file 'Source.py' with the dataset file in the same folder.

Upon running the file, the output displays the decision tree before pruning. Later, the program also outputs the chi square vales for the nodes and the tree after pruning.

Each node is represented by |xxx| and the branch is represented by xxx : yyy, where xxx is the attribute and yyy is a value of the attribute.

Example : 

------ | Patrons | 
----------- Patrons : Full
---------------- | Hungry | 
--------------------- Hungry : No
--------------------------  Will Wait ? No
