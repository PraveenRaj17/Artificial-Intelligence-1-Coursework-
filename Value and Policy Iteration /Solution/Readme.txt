"Value Iteration and Policy Iteration" in a Markov Decision Problem.

Assignment: 

Write a program to define an MDP problem for a generic grid world (e.g. figure 17.1 of AIMA Textbook 4th edition page 563) and use value iteration (figure 17.6) to print the values of states in each iteration. After termination of the value iteration, the final policy should be printed.
Next, implement a modified policy iteration (policy iteration algorithm is provided in figure 17.9 and modified policy iteration is discussed on page 578) to calculate and print the optimal policy.
The description of MDP (T, R, gamma, and epsilon) should be loaded from the text file as input. You can use the sample input format included with the assignment or use your own.

Language used : Python
Interpreter : Python 3.8.8

The file ‘Source.py’ contains the source code for the program which implements value iteration and policy iteration

The program accepts an input file mdu_input.txt containing details of the board, rewards and values of other constants.

The comments in the text file can be changed as liked.
However, the lines containing the values are not supposed to be changed, including the description.
File name is not supposed to be changed.
